H2 - Comparative Analysis of Multiple Deep CNN Models for Waste Classification
*
Waste is a wealth in a wrong place. Our research focuses on analyzing possibilities for automatic waste sorting and collecting in such a way that helps it for further recycling process. Various approaches are being practiced managing waste but not efficient and require human intervention. The automatic waste segregation would fit in to fill the gap. The project tested well known Deep Learning Network architectures for waste classification with dataset combined from own endeavors and Trash Net. The convolutional neural network is used for image classification. The hardware built in the form of dustbin is used to segregate those wastes into different compartments. Without the human exercise in segregating those waste products, the study would save the precious time and would introduce the automation in the area of waste management. Municipal solid waste is a huge, renewable source of energy. The situation is win-win for both government, society and industrialists. Because of fine-tuning of the ResNet18 Network, the best validation accuracy was found to be 87.8%.

H2 - Age Range Estimation Using MTCNN and VGG-Face Model
*
The Convolutional Neural Network has amazed us with its usage on several applications. Age range estimation using CNN is emerging due to its application in myriad of areas which makes it a state-of-the-art area for research and improve the estimation accuracy. A deep CNN model is used for identification of people's age range in our proposed work. At first, we extracted only face images from image dataset using MTCNN to remove unnecessary features other than face from the image. Secondly, we used random crop technique for data augmentation to improve the model performance. We have used the concept of transfer learning in our research. A pretrained face recognition model i.e VGG-Face is used to build our model for identification of age range whose performance is evaluated on Adience Benchmark for confirming the efficacy of our work. The performance in test set outperformed existing state-of-the-art by substantial margins.

### Comparative Analysis of CPU and GPU Profiling for Deep Learning Models
*
Deep Learning(DL) and Machine Learning(ML) applications are rapidly increasing in recent days. Massive amounts of data are being generated over the internet which can derive meaningful results by the use of ML and DL algorithms. Hardware resources and open-source libraries have made it easy to implement these algorithms. Tensorflow and Pytorch are one of the leading frameworks for implementing ML projects. By using those frameworks, we can trace the operations executed on both GPU and CPU to analyze the resource allocations and consumption. This paper presents the time and memory allocation of CPU and GPU while training deep neural networks using Pytorch. This paper analysis shows that GPU has a lower running time as compared to CPU for deep neural networks. For a simpler network, there are not many significant improvements in GPU over the CPU.

### Mixed Reality: The Interface of the Future
*
The world is slowly moving towards everything being simulated digitally and virtually. Mixed Reality (MR) is the amalgam of the real world with virtual stimuli. It has great prospects in the future in terms of various applications additionally with some challenges. This paper focuses on how Mixed Reality could be used in the future along with the challenges that could arise. Several application areas along with the potential benefits are studied in this research. Three research questions are proposed, analyzed, and concluded through the experiments. While the availability of MR devices could introduce a lot of potential, specific challenges need to be scrutinized by the developers and manufacturers. Overall, MR technology has a chance to enhance personalized, supportive, and interactive experiences for human lives.
